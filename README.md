# Overview

Surf's Up.

The purpose of this analysis is to decide on the feasability of establishing a new surf
shop and ice cream parlor in  Hawaii. Rainfall and temperature data was collected and analyzed,
this part focusing in on temperature differences comparing June and December.

## Results

After the data was collected the following results were compared:

![June](https://github.com/Jelsik/Surf_SQL/blob/main/JuneTemps.PNG)

These were the results for June temperatures, and

![December](https://github.com/Jelsik/Surf_SQL/blob/main/DecemberTemps.PNG)

These are the temperatures for December.

### Analysis

* Observing the averages, we can see that the temperatures in the region appear to be stable, as the difference
between both means is low, about 3 degrees.

* In addition, the maximum observed temperatures for the two months is nearly equal as well.

* The only sizeable difference between temperatures in June and December is in the minimum temperature, with
June remaining far closer to the mean than december

## Summary

The results of these temperature comparisons leads me to believe that this business idea is feasible. Although
it may be a little chilly at its worse in December, at worst being 56 degrees. This is still far higher than
many regions in the world experience during winter. Temperatures are stable enough that a surfing crowd could be
expected year-round. Two additional queries I believe that would be necessary in order to make a final decision
are starting this business are: 1. The wind speeds recorded during the year, in order to gain some additional information
on how calm or surfable the waters may be, and 2. Moving back and investigating the number of rainy days and the measure
of how much it rained, especially in what would be considered the rainy season, in order to see how often the sun would
be out, therefore ensuring surfers may arrive. With all of these considerations, a more final picture of the region's
weather could be formed, and the decision to start or not start the surf shop could be finalized.
